# myfewbucks-frontend

### Live at:
I'm using Netlify to automatic deploy the master branch at:
https://myfewbucks.netlify.com/

### My goals:
Develop a personal finance application, to practice my project manegement, UI prototyping,
front-end and back-end development skills.
<br>
### Frameworks and Tools:
I will use the combo React/TypeScript, that i've been working with for a while, to get to know about React Hooks.
Also, i will be working with Figma to prototype and Material-UI, both i've never used before and might be 
interesting to me in the future.
### Usage
- Install all the dependencies:
```
yarn install
```

- Run the dev server:
```
npm run dev
```

- Build the production files into the `dist` directory:
```
npm run build
```
